\title{
Surplus Production Stock Reduction Analysis using a mean-length estimate of current stock depletion
}
\description{
A surplus production equivalent of DB-SRA that uses a demographically derived prior for intrinsic rate of increase. A prior for depletion is calculated from a mean-length estimator
}
\usage{
SPSRA_ML(x, DLM_data, reps = 100)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
\item{x}{
A position in a data-limited methods data object
}
\item{DLM_data}{
A data-limited methods data object (class DLM)
}
  \item{reps}{
The number of samples of the TAC taken
}
