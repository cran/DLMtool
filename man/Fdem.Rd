\title{
Demographic FMSY method 
}
\description{
FMSY is calculated as r/2 where r is calculated from a demographic approach (inc steepness). Coupled with an estimate of current abundance that gives you the OFL. 
}
\usage{
Fdem(x, DLM_data, reps = 100)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
A position in data-limited methods data object
}
  \item{DLM_data}{
A data-limited methods data object
}
  \item{reps}{
The number of TAC samples
}
}
\details{
Made up for this package. This uses Murdoch McAllister's demographic r method to derive FMSY (r/2) and then makes the quota r*current biomass / 2. Easy.
