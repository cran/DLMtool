\title{
Beddington and Kirkwood life-history analysis with mean-length estimator of current abundance
}
\description{
Uses an approximation to FMSY based on length at first capture and an estimate of current abundance based on a mean-length estimator.

\usage{
BK_ML(x, DLM, reps = 100)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
