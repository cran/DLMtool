\title{Reads MLE estimates from Stock Synthesis file structure into an operating model using package r4ss}
\usage{
SS2DLM(SSdir, nsim = 48, proyears = 50, length_timestep = NA,
  Name = NULL, Source = "No source provided",
  Author = "No author provided", printstats = F, verbose = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{SSdir}{A folder with Stock Synthesis input and output files in it}

\item{nsim}{The number of simulations to take for parameters with uncertainty (for OM@cpars custom parameters)}

\item{proyears}{The number of projection years for MSE}

\item{length_timestep}{The duration (in years) of each timestep in the model (if an quarterly model is used this is 0.25)}

\item{Name}{The name of the operating model}

\item{Source}{Reference to assessment documentation e.g. a url}

\item{Author}{Who did the assessment}

\item{printstats}{Should the r4ss function SS_output return info on data that was read in?}

\item{verbose}{Should the r4ss function SS_ouput return detailed messages?}
}
\description{
A function that uses the file location of a fitted SS3 model including input files to population the various slots of an operating model with MLE parameter estimates
