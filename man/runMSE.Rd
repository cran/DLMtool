\arguments{
\item{OM}{An operating model object (class 'OM')}

\item{MPs}{A vector of methods (character string) of class MP}

\item{CheckMPs}{Logical to indicate if \link{Can} function should be used to check
if MPs can be run.}

\item{timelimit}{Maximum time taken for a method to carry out 10 reps
(methods are ignored that take longer)}

\item{Hist}{Should model stop after historical simulations? Returns a list
containing all historical data}

\item{ntrials}{Maximum of times depletion and recruitment deviations are
resampled to optimize for depletion. After this the model stops if more than
percent of simulations are not close to the required depletion}

\item{fracD}{Maximum allowed proportion of simulations where depletion is not
close to sampled depletion from OM before model stops with error}

\item{CalcBlow}{Should low biomass be calculated where this is the spawning
biomass at which it takes HZN mean generation times of zero fishing to reach
Bfrac fraction of SSBMSY}

\item{HZN}{The number of mean generation times required to reach Bfrac SSBMSY
in the Blow calculation}

\item{Bfrac}{The target fraction of SSBMSY for calculating Blow}

\item{AnnualMSY}{Logical. Should MSY statistics be calculated for each projection year?
May differ from MSY statistics from last historical year if there are changes in productivity}

\item{silent}{Should messages be printed out to the console?}

\item{PPD}{Logical. Should posterior predicted data be included in the MSE object Misc slot?}

\item{parallel}{Logical. Should the MSE be run using parallel processing?}

\item{save_name}{Character. Optional name to save parallel MSE list}

\item{checks}{Logical. Run tests?}

\item{control}{control options for testing and debugging}

\item{maxsims}{Maximum number of simulations per packet}

\item{name}{Character string for name of saved MSE packets (if \code{savePack=TRUE})
and final MSE object. If none provided, it uses the first five letters from the \code{OM} name}

\item{unique}{Logical. Should the name be unique? Current date and time appended to name.}

\item{maxCrash}{Maximum number of consecutive crashes before the MSE stops}

\item{saveMSE}{Logical to indicate if final MSE object should be saved to current
working directory (this is probably a good idea)}

\item{savePack}{Logical to indicate if packets should be save to current working directory}

\item{...}{Arguments to runMSE function}
}
\value{
An object of class \linkS4class{MSE}
}
\description{
A function that runs a Management Strategy Evaluation (closed-loop
simulation) for a specified operating model
}
\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{runMSE}: Default function to use.

\item \code{runMSErobust}: Save out the results to a Rdata
file.  To increase speed and efficiency, particulary for runs with a large
number simulations (\code{nsim}), the simulations are split into a number of
packets.  The functions loops over the packets and combines the output into
a single MSE object. If the MSE model crashes during a run, the MSE is run
again until it is successfully completed. The MSE is stopped if the number
of consecutive crashes exceeds \code{maxCrash}.  There is an option to save
the packets as Rdata files to the current working directory (default is
FALSE). By default, the functions saves the completed MSE object as a Rdata
file (to the current working directory).
