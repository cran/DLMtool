\title{
Run a Management Strategy Evaluation
}
\description{
A function that runs a Management Strategy Evaluation (closed-loop simulation) for a specified operating model
}
\usage{
runMSE(OM = "1", MPs = NA, nsim = 48, proyears = 28, 
       interval = 4, pstar = 0.5, maxF = 0.8, 
       timelimit = 1, reps=1)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{OM}{
An operating model object (class OM)
}
  \item{MPs}{
A vector of methods (character string) of class DLM_output or DLM_input.
}
  \item{nsim}{
Number of simulations
}
  \item{proyears}{
Number of projected years
}
  \item{interval}{
The assessment interval - how often would you like to update the management system?
}
  \item{pstar}{
The percentile of the sample of the management recommendation for each method
}
  \item{maxF}{
Maximum instantaneous fishing mortality rate that may be simulated for any given age class
}
  \item{timelimit}{
Maximum time taken for a method to carry out 10 reps (methods are ignored that take longer)
}
 \item{reps}{
Number of samples of the management recommendation for each method. Note that when this is set to 1, the mean value of the data inputs is used. 
}
}
\value{
An object of class MSE
