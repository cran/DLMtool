\title{Identify management procedures (MPs) based on data availability}
\usage{
Can(Data, timelimit = 1, MPs = NA, dev = FALSE)

Cant(Data, timelimit = 1)

Needed(Data, timelimit = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{Data}{A data-limited methods data object (class Data)}

\item{timelimit}{The maximum time (seconds) taken for an MP to undertake
5 reps (this filters out methods that are too slow)}

\item{MPs}{Optional list of MP names}

\item{dev}{Logical. Run in development mode?}
}
\description{
Diagnostic tools that look up the slot requirements of each MP and
compares to the data available in the Data object.
}
\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{Can}: Identifies MPs that have the correct data, do not produce errors,
and run within the time limit.

\item \code{Cant}: Identifies MPs that don't have sufficient data, lead to errors, or don't run in
time along with a list of their data requirements.

\item \code{Needed}: Identifies what data are needed to run
the MPs that are currently not able to run given a Data
object
}}
