\title{
Geromont and Butterworth target Harvest Control Rule
}
\description{
A harvest control rule similar to SBT2 that modifies a time-series of catch recommendations aims for target catch rate and catch level based on BMSY/B0 and MSY, respectively.
}
\usage{
GB_target(x, DLM, reps = 100, w = 0.5)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
A position in data-limited methods data object
}
  \item{DLM}{
A data-limited methods data object
}
  \item{reps}{
The number of quota samples
}  \item{w}{
A gain parameter
}
}
\details{
Note that this is my interpretation of their approach and is now stochastic. Currently it is generalized and is not 'tuned' to more detailed assessment data which might explain why in some cases it leads to stock declines.
