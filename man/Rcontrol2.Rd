\title{
MP using prior for intrinsic rate of increase with a quadratic approximation to surplus production
}
\description{
An MP proposed by Carl Walters that modifies quotas according to trends in apparent surplus production that includes information from a demographically derived prior for intrinsic rate of increase. This is different from Rcontrol because it includes a quadratic approximation of recent trend in surplus production given biomass
