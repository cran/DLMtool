\title{Beddington and Kirkwood life-history MP (simple version)}
\usage{
BK(x, DLM_data, reps = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in a data-limited methods data object.}

\item{DLM_data}{A data-limited methods data object.}

\item{reps}{The number of stochastic samples of the TAC recommendation}
}
\description{
Sets an OFL according to current abundance and an approximation of FMSY
based on length at first capture.
}

This is the simple version of the BK MP. The paper has a more complex
approach that might work better.
