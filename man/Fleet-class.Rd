\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{Name}}{Name of the Fleet object}

\item{\code{nyears}}{The number of years for the historical simulation}

\item{\code{Spat_targ}}{Distribution of fishing in relation to spatial biomass: F is proportional to B^Spat_targ (uniform distribution)}

\item{\code{Esd}}{Inter-annual variability in fishing mortality rate}

\item{\code{EffYears}}{Vector of verticies, years at which to simulate varying relative effort}

\item{\code{EffLower}}{Lower bound on relative effort corresponding to EffYears (uniform distribution)}

\item{\code{EffUpper}}{Uppper bound on relative effort corresponding to EffYears (uniform distribution)}

\item{\code{LFS}}{Shortest length that is fully vulnerable to fishing (uniform distribution)}

\item{\code{L5}}{Shortest length corresponding to 5 percent vulnerability (uniform distribution)}
