\title{Less Precautionary Index Confidence Interval MP by Jardim et al. (2015)}
\usage{
ICI2(x, Data, reps)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in data-limited methods data object}

\item{Data}{A data-limited methods data object}

\item{reps}{The number of TAC samples}
}
\description{
The MP adjusts catch based on the value of the index in the current year relative to the 
time series mean and standard error.
There are two thresholds which delineates whether catch is reduced, held constant, or increased.
This method is less precautionary of the two ICI MPs by allowing for a larger increase in TAC
and a lower threshold of the index to decrease the TAC (see Jardim et al. 2015).
