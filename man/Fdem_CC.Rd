\title{
Demographic FMSY method using catch-curve analysis to estimate recent Z
}
\description{
FMSY is calculated as r/2 from a demographic r prior method, current abudnance is estimated from naive catch curve analysis.
}
\usage{
Fdem_CC(x, DLM_data, reps = 100, Fmin=0.005)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.

  \item{DLM_data}{
A data-limited methods data object
}
  \item{reps}{
The number of TAC samples
}
  \item{Fmin}{
