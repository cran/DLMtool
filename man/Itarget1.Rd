\title{
A management procedure that incrementally adjusts the TAC (starting from reference level that is a fraction of mean recent catches) to reach a target CPUE / relative abundance index.
}
\description{
The least biologically precautionary of two index/CPUE target MPs proposed by Geromont and Butterworth 2014. Tested by Carruthers et al. 2015
}
\usage{
Itarget1(x, DLM_data, reps = 100, yrsmth = 5, xx=0, Imulti=1.5)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
A position in data-limited methods data object
}
  \item{DLM_data}{
A data-limited methods data object
}
  \item{reps}{
The number of TAC samples
}
  \item{yrsmth}{
Years over which to smooth recent estimates of surplus production  
}
\item{xx}{
Parameter controlling the fraction of mean catch to start using in first year
}
\item{Imulti}{
Parameter controlling how much larger target CPUE / index is compared with recent levels.
}
