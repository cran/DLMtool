\title{
Catch trend Surplus Production MSY MP
}
\description{
An MP that uses Martell and Froese (2012) method for estimating MSY to determine the OFL. Since their approach estimates stock trajectories based on catches and a rule for intrinsic rate of increase it also returns depletion. Given their surplus production model predicts K, r and depletion it is straighforward to calculate the OFL based on the Schaefer productivity curve. OFL = dep x (1-dep) x r x K x 2

\usage{
SPMSY(x, DLM_data, reps = 100)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
\item{x}{
A position in a data-limited methods data object
}
\item{DLM_data}{
A data-limited methods data object 
}
  \item{reps}{
The number of samples of the TAC
}
}
\details{
Requires the assumption that catch is proportional to abundance. Occasionally the rule that limits r and K ranges does not allow r-K pairs to be found that lead to the depletion inferred by the catch trajectories. In this case this method widens the search.
