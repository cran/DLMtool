\title{
An FMSY/M ratio method paired with the 40-10 rule
}
\description{
Calculates the OFL based on a fixed ratio of FMSY to M multiplied by a current estimate of abundance. In this method DBSRA is paired with the 40-10 rule that throttles back the OFL to zero at 10 percent of unfished biomass.
