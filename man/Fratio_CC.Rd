\title{
A data-limited method that uses FMSY/M ratio and a naive catch-curve estimate of recent Z
}
\description{
Calculates the OFL based on a fixed ratio of FMSY to M and a catch curve estimate of current stock size.
}
\usage{
Fratio_CC(x, DLM_data, reps = 100, Fmin = 0.005)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{

A data-limited methods data object
}
  \item{reps}{
The number of TAC samples
}
\item{Fmin}{
Minimum current fishing mortality rate for the catch-curve analysis
