\title{
Extra Depletion Corrected Average Catch
}
\description{
Essentially DCAC multiplied by 2*depletion and divided by BMSY/B0 (Bpeak)
}
\usage{
EDCAC(x, DLM_data, reps = 100)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
A position in a data-limited methods data object
}
  \item{DLM_data}{
A data-limited methods data object
}
  \item{reps}{
The number of stochastic samples of the TAC recommendation
}
