\title{
A management procedure that incrementally adjusts the Effort to reach a target CPUE / relative abundance index.
}
\description{
An effort-based version of the most biologically precautionary of two index/CPUE target MPs proposed by Geromont and Butterworth 2014.

\arguments{
  \item{x}{
A position in data-limited methods data object
