     \itemize{
     \item RefY: reference yield, the highest long-term yield (mean over last five years of projection) obtained from a fixed F strategy. This is a useful reference point for framing performance of MPs because it standardizes for starting point and future productivity.

     \item Kgrad: mean gradient in maximum growth rate (per cent per time step)
     \item Linfsd: interannual variability in maximum length (log normal CV)

     \item Ksd: interannual variability in maximum growth rate (log normal CV)
     \item ageM: age at 50 per cent maturity
     \item LFS: length at full selection (the shortest length class where fishery selectivity is 100 per cent)
     \item age05: the age at 5 percent selectivity (ascending limb of selectivity curve)
     \item Vmaxage: the selectivity of the oldest age class (controls dome shape of selectivity curve)

     \item OFLreal: the true simulated Over Fishing Limit (FMSY x biomass) updated in each management update of the projection
     \item Spat_targ: spatial targetting parameter, fishing mortality rate across areas is proportional to vulnerable biomass raised to the power of this number. 
     \item Frac_area_1: the fraction of unfished biomass inhabiting area 1 (can be seen as fraction of habitat in area 1 or relative size of area 1)
     \item Prob_staying: the probability that individuals in area 1 remain there between time-steps
     \item AC: autocorrelation in recruitment
