\title{
Yield Per Recruit analysis to get FMSY proxy F01 paired to a naive catch curve estimate of recent Z
}
\description{
A simple yield per recruit approximation to FMSY (F01) which is the position of the ascending YPR curve for which dYPR/dF = 0.1(dYPR/d0)
A naive catch-curve analysis is used to determine recent Z which given M (Mort) gives F and thus abundance = Ct/(1-exp(-F))
