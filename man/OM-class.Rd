\title{Class \code{"OM"}}
\description{
An object containing all the parameters needed to control the MSE which can be build from component Stock, Fleet and Observation objects. Almost all of these inputs are a vector of length 2 which describes the upper and lower bounds of a uniform distribution from which to sample the parameter. 
}
\section{Objects from the Class}{
Objects can be created by calls of the form \code{new("OM", Stock, Fleet, Observation)}.
