\title{
An FMSY/M ratio method that uses a mean length estimator of recent Z
}
\description{
Calculates the OFL based on a fixed ratio of FMSY/M and an estimate of current stock size from a mean-length estimator.

\usage{
Fratio_ML(x, DLM, reps = 100)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
