\title{
Dynamic Fratio MP
}
\description{
The Fratio MP with a controller that changes the level of F according to the relationship between Surplus production and biomass. Ie lower F when dSP/dB is positive and higher F when dSP/dB is negative. 
}
\usage{
DynF(x, DLM_data, yrsmth=10, gg=2, reps = 100)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
A position in a data-limited methods object
}
  \item{DLM_data}{
A data-limited methods object
}
   \item{yrsmth}{
The number of historical recent years used for smoothing catch and biomass data
}  
  \item{gg}{
A gain parameter that modifies F according to the gradient in surplus production with biomass
}
  \item{reps}{
The number samples of the TAC
}
}
\details{
The method smoothes historical catches and biomass and then infers the relationship between surplus production and biomass (as suggested by Mark Maunder and Carl Walters). The approach then regulates a F based policy according to this gradient in which F may range between two different fractions of natural mortality rate. 

The core advantage is the TAC(t) is not strongly determined by TAC(t-1) and therefore errors are not as readily propagated. The result is method that tends to perform alarmingly well and therefore requires debunking ASAP.
