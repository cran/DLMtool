\title{
Effort searching version of DD - Delay - Difference Stock Assessment with UMSY and MSY leading that fishes at 75 per cent of FMSY
}
\description{
A simple delay-difference assessment that estimates FMSY using a time-series of catches and a relative abundance index. The MP provides a change in effort in the direction of FMSY up to a maximum change of 10 percent.

\usage{
DDes(x, DLM_data, reps = 100, LB=0.9, UB=1.1)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.

\note{
This DD model is observation error only and has does not estimate process error (recruitment deviations). Similar to many other assessment models it depends on a whole host of dubious assumptions such as temporally stationary productivity and proportionality between the abundance index and real abundance. Unsurprisingly the extent to which these assumptions are violated tends to be the biggest driver of performance for this method.
