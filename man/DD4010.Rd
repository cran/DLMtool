\title{Delay - Difference Stock Assessment with UMSY and MSY leading coupled with a
40-10 harvest control rule}
\usage{
DD4010(x, Data, reps = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in a data-limited methods data object}

\item{Data}{A data-limited methods data object}

\item{reps}{The number of stochastic samples of the TAC recommendation}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of TAC recommendations
}
\description{
A simple delay-difference assessment that estimates the OFL using a
time-series of catches and a relative abundance index. In this version of
the DD MP a 40-10 rule is imposed over the OFL recommendation.
