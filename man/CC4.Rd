\title{
Constant catch management procedure of Geromont and Butterworth (2014)
}
\description{
The TAC is the average catch over last yrsmth years reduced by 30%.
}
\usage{
CC4(x, DLM, reps = 100, yrsmth = 5, xx=0.3)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{

}
  \item{reps}{

}
  \item{yrsmth}{
