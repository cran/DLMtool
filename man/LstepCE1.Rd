\title{
A management procedure that incrementally adjusts the TAC according to the mean length of recent catches.
}
\description{
A effort-based version of least biologically precautionary of four adaptive length-based MPs proposed by Geromont and Butterworth 2014. Tested by Carruthers et al. 2015
}
\usage{
LstepCE1(x, DLM_data, reps = 100, yrsmth = 5, xx = 0, stepsz = 0.05, 
  llim = c(0.96, 0.98, 1.05))
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
