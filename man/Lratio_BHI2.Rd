\title{The more general version of the mean length-based indicator MP of Jardim et al. 2015.}
\usage{
Lratio_BHI2(x, Data, reps, yrsmth = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in data-limited methods data object}

\item{Data}{A data-limited methods data object}

\item{reps}{The number of TAC samples}

\item{yrsmth}{The most recent years of data to smooth the calculation of the mean length}
}
\description{
The TAC is adjusted by the ratio alpha, where the numerator 
is the mean length of the catch and the denominator is the mean length expected
when FMSY = M and M/K = 1.5. Natural mortality M and von Bertalanffy K are not used in this MP 
(see Appendix A of Jardim et al. 2015).
Argument yrsmth currently takes the mean length of the most recent 3 years of data 
as a smoother.
