\title{
A management procedure that incrementally adjusts the TAC to maintain a constant CPUE or relative abundance index.
}
\description{
The least biologically precautionary of two constant index / CPUE methods proposed by Geromont and Butterworth 2014. Tested by Carruthers et al. 2015
}
\usage{
Islope1(x, DLM, reps = 100, yrsmth = 5, lambda=0.4,xx=0.2)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
A position in data-limited methods data object
}
  \item{DLM}{

}
  \item{reps}{

}
  \item{yrsmth}{
Years over which to smooth recent estimates of surplus production  
}
\item{lambda}{
